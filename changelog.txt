PyTivo Video Manager - change log

Version 0.5a 

moved metaignore and metafirst into config file so you can specify which metadata you would like
to ignore and which you would liek to see first

Added logic to show folder.jpg as the thumbnail for a directory if it exists in that directory or in the
subtending .meta directory

Version 0.5

-added the ability to specify deleteallowed=False in the config file to prevent file deletions
-formalized the skin concept.  Now skins are kept in separate directories under the skins directory, and
the directory you want to use for a skin is named in the config file e.g. skin=blue.  ALso, changed the
image loading logic such that if the HD version of an image does not exist, then it will use the SD version
of that file.  This solved the situation where there were duplicate files just to satisfy a naming convention.
- moved metadata.py into the vidmgr directory.  It didn't belong up in the pyhme directory and I never liked
having it up there.  I was too unfamiliar with python to know how to specify to look in the vidmgr subdirectory
to find the file (it turns out I didn't need to do anything - python found it!!)
- split README.txt into README.txt and changelog.txt.  changelog.txt will contain the change history, and README
will be maintained as the always current description of the application
- fixed the positioning bug in 0.4c where the "Push" button was over top of the bottom line of the description

Version 0.4c

Adjusted thumbnail position and calculated description height based in descsize so that only full lines appear

version 0.4b

Increased list size on HD screen from 12 to 14

version 0.4

Added an info page that pops up when you press the info button and displays all the metadata about the current video

version 0.3c

Fixed bug when navigating OUT of an empty directory and bug where share list was not being updated when a video is deleted

version 0.3b

Added 1) share and directory listings show the number of videos and directories contained within them, and 2) added a "Please Wait" icon
during length operations - currently this includes:  building a directory listing, pushing a video, and deleting a video.

version 0.3a

Removed the clear key - it no longer exits the app. 
Removed calls to unicode from metadata.py
Added functionality to advance key - if pressed while at the end of a list, it will move to the start of the list.

version 0.3

Allow various sorting and display options:
display=file - only display the file name
       =episodetitle - only display the episode name
       =episodenumtitle = display both the episode number and name
if not specified (or if an invalid option is specified) then it will display title+episode title
If you specify metadata that does not exist, vidmgr will use the title and/or the file name in order to display something

sort=file - sort the screen listing based on the file name only
    =episodenumber - sort based on the episode number (if present) - NOTE - this is a character string comparison - not numeric
If not specified (or if an invalid option is specified) sorting will be based on title and/or file name
Again, if the specified meta data does not exist, a sort key will be built from whatever is available using title and/or filename

Also in version 0.3 - fixed the issue reported by reneg where shares on the second and subsequent pages of the shares listing were wrong


version 0.2g 

When deleting a video, if the meta file was in the .meta directory, it was not
deleted.  Also, the jpg artwork file was not deleted either.  Both of these 
have been fixed

version 0.2f

Version 0.2f properly implements what 0.2e was supposed to do

Change with 0.2e

Allow artwork to be placed in the .meta subdirectory

version 0.2d

Changes with 0.2d

Ignore directories beginning with . - this allows .meta directories for holding pytivo meta data

Changes with 0.2c

Added descsize option to alter size of description font

Changes with 0.2b

Added logic to metadata.py to strip non-ascii chars from meta data

Changes with version 0.2

Support HD resolution - this allows addition of screen capture/art work.  Also, tried to pay more
attention to TV safe area - although this is hard for HD since the simulator doesn't support HD.
Added exts option to config file.
